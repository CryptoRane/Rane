 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Rane Core

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Rane Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides rane-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a rane daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
